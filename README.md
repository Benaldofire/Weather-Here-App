# Weather-Here-App
Based on Joey Lee's project 'The Weather Here'. Also followed coding train's tutorial and i personally added some extra css, javascript aspects.

This was a useful short project to get me aquainted with web APIs. 
I followed Coding Train's tutorial "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YxDKpFzf_2D84p0cyk4T7X", 
which was very useful in helping me understand how to work with APIs and how to hide my API key. I was able to apply a bit of my css knowledge in order to make the site a bit more appealing.
This is not something that is intended to view on mobile, because i did not pay attension to the responsiveness of the site since it was not on my priority list. 
This gave me some ideas on how to apply the knowledge gained to my own on going projects.

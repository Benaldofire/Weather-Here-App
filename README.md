# Weather-Here-App
Based on Joey Lee's project 'The Weather Here'. Also followed coding train's tutorial and i personally added some extra css, javascript aspects.

This was a useful short project to get me aquainted with web APIs. 
I followed Coding Train's tutorial "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YxDKpFzf_2D84p0cyk4T7X", 
which was very useful in helping me understand how to work with APIs and how to hide my API key. I was able to apply a bit of my css knowledge in order to make the site a bit more appealing.

Things learnt:
-This small project gave me some ideas on how to apply the knowledge gained to my own on going projects. Especially working on the server side code in order to send the API data   to the front end. 
-The API used in the video was no longer in service so I had to go and search for another weather API (https://openweathermap.org/) and i got first hand experience with reading the documentation and experimenting with the data retrieved. 
-Experience with express 
-fetch request
-NEDB database experience

NOTE: if you fork or clone this project, it will not work due to the lack of an API key. You can get an API key for free by registering at https://openweathermap.org/.
You are free to use other weather API but that will require you to change the javascript & server side code to fit the json format.
